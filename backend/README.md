This is a REST API backend for a loyalty program using Express.js and Prisma. This loyalty program will enable users to accumulate points for purchases and redeem them for free items, similar to PC Optimum. The objective is to develop the backend infrastructure for the loyalty program, which will serve as the foundation for your term project later.
