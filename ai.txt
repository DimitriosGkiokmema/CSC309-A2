AI Usage:

We used AI mainly to teach us concepts we struggled with and help with styling (css) of 
some components.

As we are relatively new to React, we found AI useful at explaining concepts like components, 
states, and routing. These were a bit difficult for us to understand at first, so we used AI
to teach us the basics.

Additionally, we found it useful at generating aesthetic styling that we applied to the site.
For instance, we were stuck on what to put in the home page, so Dimitrios gave Chat GPT a breakdown of
the site's theme, and instructed it to populate the homepage as such. The blue Varsity Mart element
and the What We Offer section was what the AI produced.

In short, AI was used to:
1) help teach us difficult/new concepts
2) Complete trivial tasks like style/create html elements
